PayPal Next Date
================
For monthly billing cycles, recurring payments are collected on the same day of the month. If the initial recurring payment falls on the 31st, PayPal eventually adjusts the billing cycle to the 1st of the month. If the initial recurring payment falls on the 29th or 30th, PayPal adjusts the billing cycle to the 1st of the month on the following February. 

This is useful for displaying a "renewal date"  on a user dashboard for monthly-renewed PayPal subscriptions.
